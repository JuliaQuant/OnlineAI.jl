Machine learning for sequential/streaming data

## This is a work in progress! Use at your own risk...

## Roadmap/todo:
- Neural net framework with plug and play components
- Simple network building.  Give type of problem, desired input/output, and let it figure out a good network design
- Focus on time series models.
- Recurrent networks, time delay networks, LSTM.
- Mini-batch and single updates
- Echo state networks / Liquid state machines
